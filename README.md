# portfolio-tracker

## Journey

The idea for a stock and crypto portfolio tracker came about when I realised that my curerent solution- A big messy excel spreadsheet- was too convoluted and could be done in a much cleaner fashion. I want to do all the calculations I was doing manually to be done in the app and for it to display information in a clean and understasndable fashion.
