# portfolio-tracker

## Journey

The idea for a stock and crypto portfolio tracker came about when I realised that my curerent solution- A big messy excel spreadsheet- was too convoluted and could be done in a much cleaner fashion. I want to do all the calculations I was doing manually to be done in the app and for it to display information in a clean and understasndable fashion.

Notes: Got stuck on configuration problems for a while, make sure everything is configured before you use it and take time to configure correctly at the start of the build. I made some changes to the shade of blue on build time for better UI/UX design. Pretty happy with progress overall though, now the navbar is done I will just start to work on the pages themselves.
