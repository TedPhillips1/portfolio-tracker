# portfolio-tracker

## Journey

The idea for a stock and crypto portfolio tracker came about when I realised that my curerent solution- A big messy excel spreadsheet- was too convoluted and could be done in a much cleaner fashion. I want to do all the calculations I was doing manually to be done in the app and for it to display information in a clean and understasndable fashion.

- Made Logo
- Changed shade of blue in styling.md
- Installed Required Dependencies
- Researched how the app will work/fit together
- Made Navbar and all its components
- Made pages and used them to make navbar functional
- Configured Auth0 to next.js
- added Auth0 to Navbar
- Configured styled-components to next.js
- added a custom font
- Planned tomorrows sprint

Notes: Got stuck on configuration problems for a while, make sure everything is configured before you use it and take time to configure correctly at the start of the build. I made some changes to the shade of blue on build time for better UI/UX design. Pretty happy with progress overall though, now the navbar is done I will just start to work on the pages themselves.

### 14/2/2022

- Made Laning Page Components
- Put it together

### 15/2/2022

- Played around with some CSS features such as:
  - Gradients
  - Animations
- Learned about styled-component keyframes

A big aim today was to find how to give my design a professional feel. I felt that my landing page from yesterday had a beginner/basic look but by adding some simple things like a fade in and design element it took the design up a notch. I will continue to find little tricks like this to give my design an edge.
I've also decided that I am going to scrap the about page and fill out the landing page some more.

### 16/2/2022

- Played around with more animations
- Tried to use Intersection Observer to trigger anuimation on scroll but couldn't get it working

Probably going to try again tomorrow with intersection observer however I may move on if I can't do it tomorrow.
